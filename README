## Handwritten Digit Classification using SVM

A project that uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify handwritten digits (0–9) from the load_digits dataset in scikit-learn. The project includes data exploration, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

📌 Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the digits dataset

Baseline SVM model training and evaluation

Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Confusion matrix and classification report visualization

Visualization of predicted vs actual digits

📂 Dataset

The project uses the load_digits dataset from scikit-learn:

1797 grayscale images of digits (8×8 pixels)

64 features per sample (pixel intensity values)

Target labels: digits 0–9

All digits are handwritten by humans, making recognition more challenging than typed digits

📈 Results

Baseline SVM accuracy: ~98%

Confusion matrix shows minimal misclassifications between visually similar digits

Hyperparameter tuning improves model performance slightly, achieving near-optimal results

📊 Visualizations

Sample handwritten digit images

Predicted vs actual digits comparison

Confusion matrix heatmap showing correct and misclassified predictions

📌 Conclusion

The SVM model demonstrates high accuracy and reliable performance on handwritten digit recognition. Minor misclassifications mostly occur between visually similar digits, which is expected given the variability in human handwriting.
